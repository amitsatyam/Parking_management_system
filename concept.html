        <p>A Parking Management System is a software solution designed to manage parking lots efficiently. It typically involves several key components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>User Management:</strong> Users can register, login, and manage their accounts. This includes updating personal information and viewing booking history.</li>
            <li><strong>Parking Spot Management:</strong> The system maintains information about available parking spots, including their location, availability status, and pricing.</li>
            <li><strong>Booking System:</strong> Users can book parking spots in advance. The system checks availability and allows users to select spots based on their preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Integration:</strong> Users can make payments for parking bookings securely through integrated payment gateways. The system handles payment processing and generates invoices.</li>
            <li><strong>Admin Panel:</strong> Administrators have access to a dashboard where they can manage users, parking spots, bookings, and generate reports.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To implement a Parking Management System using Java and MySQL, you would typically use Java for the backend logic and MySQL for the database storage. Here's a high-level overview of the technologies involved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Java:</strong> Java provides a robust platform for developing server-side applications. You can use Java Servlets or Spring Framework to handle HTTP requests, business logic, and database interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system. You can use it to store user data, parking spot information, booking details, and other relevant data.</li>
            <li><strong>JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):</strong> JDBC is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with relational databases like MySQL. You can use JDBC to establish connections, execute SQL queries, and retrieve results from the database.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML/CSS:</strong> HTML and CSS are used to create the user interface for the Parking Management System. HTML defines the structure of web pages, while CSS is used for styling and layout.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript can be used to add interactivity to the user interface, such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and AJAX requests for asynchronous data retrieval.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By combining these technologies effectively, you can create a robust and efficient Parking Management System that meets the needs of both users and administrators.</p>
